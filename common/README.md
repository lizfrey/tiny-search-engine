#### Compilation and usage
To compile, run the `make` command. 

To use the functions in `pagedir.c`, add the `pagedir.h` header file to your file and compile correctly. 
To use the functions in `word.c`, add the `word.h` header file to your file and compile correctly. 
To use the functions in `index.c`, add the `index.h` header file to your file and compile correctly. 

#### Assumptions
If `fopen` returns null on a given `dir/.crawler` filename, the `dir` does not exist or is unwritable.
